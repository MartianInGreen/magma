# Magma
Magma is an attempt to unify Note-taking and AI applications into a singular, more powerful, experience

> NOTE: Magma is still in **very** early development, features listed below are **not yet** completed. Please look on the roadmap to see what is actually implemented.

> - [ ] **In Progress**
> - [x] Implemented

## Key Features 
- Unified note-taking and AI interface experience.
- Take Markdown-like notes with a robust feature set.
- Interact with the latest in AI, with Agents that have Tools and can help you do you work, not just write. 

## Note-taking
Magma is a note taking, knowledge management, and organization tool. Inspired by Obsidian, Reor, and Notion. 
Magma uses "blocks" for notes, the full featureset of Markdown is supported, additionally there are many more blocks than can be helpful in more specialized uses. Magma automatically converts some Markdown elements into their respective blocks.

## Tools
In addition to the AI features, Magma has some useful tools build in. These include a Calculator (using Wolfram|Alpha), a Camera for taking pictures or scanning documents, an Audio recorder with transcription, a Calendar for organisation, a Pomodoro Timer, and some more planned for the future!

## AI Tools
Magma is focused on an equally as good AI experience as note-taking experience, the goal is for you to be able to replace both your current AI application (like ChatGPT) and your current note-taking application with a single more unified one.
As part of that plan we support (custom) Plugins (with many already build in), custom Assistant (like GPTs), a Code Interpreter, chatting with Notes, and much more!
